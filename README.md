## Homework for Module 11 - Data Collection

In this assignment, I used the Splinter Selenium wrapper to scrape data from static webpages. This was done on an educational site to ensure ethical collection of the data. After collecting the data from the [news website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html), it was turned into a json file to share. Data from the [weather website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) was put into a Pandas data frame to explore further and answer questions about the weather and length of a Martian year.
